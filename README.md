## SmartMart – Complete SQL Business Intelligence Project

### Overview

**SmartMart** is a fully structured SQL project that simulates a retail business environment. It covers the complete SQL development lifecycle including database design, data insertion, reporting queries, automation, and optimization. This project is designed to help learners and professionals master all essential and advanced SQL concepts using a single end-to-end use case.

The project mimics realistic business operations such as order management, inventory tracking, customer profiling, employee records, delivery tracking, and financial transactions.

### Project Goals

* Build a relational database with normalized tables for a business use case
* Insert realistic sample data across multiple business domains
* Write SQL queries to extract KPIs and actionable business insights
* Implement database automation using views, triggers, and stored procedures
* Apply optimization techniques like indexing and window functions

---

### Tech Stack

* **Database**: MySQL
* **Tools Used**: MySQL Workbench
* **Project Scope**: SQL-only implementation (no frontend/backend scripting)

---

### Modules / Tables

* `categories`, `products`, `inventory` – Product catalog and stock management
* `customers`, `orders`, `order_items` – Customer and transaction data
* `employees`, `departments` – Human resources and reporting structure
* `deliveries`, `finance_transactions`, `promotions`, `reviews` – Business operations and customer engagement

---

### Key SQL Concepts Covered

* Database creation, table design, and normalization
* Data types, constraints, primary keys, foreign keys, unique, default, and check constraints
* Join operations: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN (using UNION)
* Aggregation functions with GROUP BY and HAVING
* Subqueries: scalar, IN, NOT IN, EXISTS, correlated
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with the `WITH` clause
* Window functions: ROW\_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD, SUM OVER, etc.
* Views: reusable reporting layers
* Stored procedures: parameterized automation
* Triggers: event-based automation logic
* Indexing: optimization using single and composite indexes
* Transactions: ACID-compliant safe operations
